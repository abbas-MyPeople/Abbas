"""Generate the local (city) and service x city pages.

Why a generator rather than 17 hand-written files: the head, schema, nav and
footer have to stay identical to the rest of the site, and they change. The nav
and footer are lifted verbatim out of an existing page at build time, so these
pages can never drift away from the other 42.

Why the content is NOT boilerplate: near-identical city pages are doorway pages,
they get filtered, and they deserve to be. Every city carries its own county,
its own real commercial corridors, its own read on what trades there, and its
own angle. That lives in geo.json, not here.
