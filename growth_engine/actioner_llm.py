growth_engine.actioner_llm — THE NEW PIECE.

When the owner's reply is NOT a clean approve/reject but a freeform instruction ("make the hero say X",
"move the pricing up", "tighten the case-study intro"), this asks Claude to interpret it into a BOUNDED,
surgical edit plan:  {page_file, section, change_description, find, replace}.

HARD GUARDRAILS
  • Only a NAMED page that EXISTS and passes the scope fence (executors.is_allowed_path) is eligible.
  • The plan must be a surgical find/replace where `find` is an EXACT existing snippet (verified to occur
    exactly once in the file). No whole-file rewrites, no invented anchors.
  • If the instruction is ambiguous or out-of-scope, Claude MUST return {"action":"clarify", ...} — we do
    NOT guess; execute.py then queues a short clarifying email back to the owner.
  • LLM COST GUARD: at most MAX_LLM_CALLS Claude calls per run; short max_tokens.
  • Kill switch (ENGINE_DISABLED=1) and missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY → no call; returns a 'skip'/'clarify'.
  • Never prints secret values.

Used for REPLY INTERPRETATION ONLY. The actual file write + validation is executors.apply_llm_plan.
